## 2. Library Management System
This Flask-based REST API allows users to manage a collection of books. It provides CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using an SQLite database. Users can:
✅ Add books with title, author, and publication year
✅ Retrieve all books or a specific book by ID
✅ Update book details
✅ Delete books

Built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Restfox, this API is ideal for learning backend development and can be expanded with authentication, pagination, or a frontend.
